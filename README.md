# WordSearchGenerator
This program will generate a word search puzzle using words supplied by
a user during program runtime. The user is presented with a menu from which they
may select to generate a new word search, print out a word search as a puzzle
with unused spaces filled in with random characters, show a solution word search
which omits random characters and only shows words from the puzzle, or print the
word search puzzle to a text file. The user may only select to view a puzzle or
solution key after they have first generated a word search. The size of the puzzle
will be scaled based on the longest word submitted to the puzzle by the user. 
The user may submit as many words as they would like to the puzzle, but
a maximum of 100 attempts will be made to successfully place a word in
the puzzle.
